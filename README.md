# C++ Programming Reference Project

## Overview
This Visual Studio project is intended to be used as a quick reference for implementing and using various programming concepts in C++. The repository contains multiple class examples and can be used as a foundation for learning, teaching, or developing larger projects.

## Planned Features
* Data Structures: Examples of common data structures like queues, stacks, linked lists, and more.
* Algorithms: Implementations of sorting, searching, and pathfinding algorithms.
* Utilities: Handy utility classes for file handling, logging, and mathematical operations.
* System Concepts: Demonstrations of memory management, multithreading, and event systems.
* Object-Oriented Design: Examples showcasing inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisite
* Visual Studio or other IDE configured to run C++ console applications

### Cloning the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dtb1996/CppReference.git
```

## Classes Overview
### Data Structures
* **Queue**: demonstrates push, pop, front, back, size, and empty functions
* **Stack**: demostrates push, pop, top, size, and empty functions
* **Linked List**: demostrates singly and doubly linked list implementations with insert, delete, and traversal functions
* **Binary Tree**: demonstrates insert, delete, and various traversal functions

More to come!
